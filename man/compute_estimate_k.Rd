\arguments{
\item{df}{dataframe containing testing dataset}

\item{Y_name}{name of outcome variable in df}

\item{A_name}{name of treatment variable in df}

\item{W_list}{character vector containing names of covariates in the dataframe to be used in nuisance models}

\item{Z_list}{character vector containing names of variables in df used to fit CATE model (variables used in treatment rule)}

\item{CATE_model}{discrete SuperLearner model for CATE}

\item{nuisance}{object of class `Nuisance` containing outcome, treatment, and missingness SuperLearner models}

\item{sign}{sign of threshold, + indicates `Y` is a desirable outcome, - indicates `Y` is an undesirable outcome}

\item{threshold}{character vector of decision thresholds for CATE to determine OTR. Values should be positive if `Y_name` is desirable outcome, negative if `Y_name` is undesirable outcome. If threshold is 0, use +0 for desirable, -0 for undesirable.}

\item{ps_trunc_level}{numeric level to use for truncation of any predicted values that fall below it}

\item{truncate_CATE}{logical to indicate if large CATE predictions should be truncated at -1 and 1 (default = TRUE)}
