\arguments{
\item{df}{dataframe containing full dataset}

\item{Y_name}{name of outcome variable in df}

\item{A_name}{name of treatment variable in df}

\item{W_list}{character vector containing names of covariates in the dataframe to be used for fitting nuisance models}

\item{Z_list}{character vector containing names of variables in df used to fit CATE model (variables used in treatment rule)}

\item{id_name}{name of participant ID variable}

\item{sl.library.CATE}{character vector of SuperLearner libraries to use to fit the CATE model}

\item{nuisance_models}{list of objects of class `Nuisance` containing outcome, treatment, and missingness SuperLearner models (only include if using pre-fit nuisance models)}

\item{k_fold_assign_and_CATE}{dataframe containing ids, fold assignments, and CATE estimate for each observation in df (only include if using pre-fit nuisance models)}

\item{sl.library.outcome}{character vector of SuperLearner libraries to use to fit the outcome models}

\item{sl.library.treatment}{character vector of SuperLearner libraries to use to fit the treatment models}

\item{sl.library.missingness}{character vector of SuperLearner libraries to use to fit the missingness models}

\item{threshold}{character vector of decision thresholds for CATE to determine OTR. Values should be positive if `Y_name` is desirable outcome, negative if `Y_name` is undesirable outcome. If threshold is 0, use +0 for desirable, -0 for undesirable.}

\item{k_folds}{integer number of folds to use for cross-validation (must specify if fitting outcome, treatment, and missingness models. Otherwise uses k from `k_fold_assign_and_CATE`)}

\item{ps_trunc_level}{numeric evel below which propensity scores will be truncated (to avoid errors in computing AIPTW)}

\item{outcome_type}{outcome_type specifying continuous (outcome_type = "gaussian") or binary (outcome_type = "binomial") outcome Y (if not providing pre-fit nuisance models)}
