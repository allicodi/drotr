Title: Doubly-robust methods for Optimal Treatment Rules
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Allison Codi
Maintainer: Allison Codi <allison.codi@emory.edu>
Description: This package estimates Optimal Treatment Rules (OTRs) and treatment effects under those optimally treated by the rule using doubly-robust methods. 
    The OTR assigns treatment to all individuals with a conditional average treatment effect (CATE) that exceeds a given threshold.
    The CATE is estimated using a Doubly-Robust (DR) Learner. Once the OTR is created, the package estimates treatment effects in the optimally treated. 
    Treatment effects are estimated using Augmented Inverse Probability of Treatment Weight (AIPTW) estimators.
